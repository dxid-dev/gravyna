As the temperature of the electronic devices increases, their failure rate increases and can result in a reduced lifespan. This is a direct implication of Moore's law for microelectronics. Due to this trend, electronics need to be efficiently cooled to work properly. To maintain optimal electronic performance, it is necessary to engineer materials so that heat can be removed efficiently, for instance, using a heat sink.

The first-principles approach such as DFT provides the best accuracy on material properties but consumes a high computational cost and long computational time if it is used to calculate huge systems. On the other hand, MD can be used to study larger and more realistic systems. Unlike DFT, the computational cost of MD calculations is linearly proportional to the number of atoms, allowing it to model systems with millions of atoms.

                    <p class="s10__desc">The most recent advances in Machine Learning methods have provided novel solutions to critical challenges for a variety of problems. One of the most recent developments in this area is the use of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to significantly improve the accuracy of MD simulations. MLIPs have recently been used successfully to predict novel materials and investigate lattice dynamics and thermal conductivity. MLIPs allow MD simulations to be performed with DFT level accuracy for computed energies and forces, but with computational costs scaling linearly with the number of atoms. Another remarkable advantage of MLIPs is that they are derived from DFT simulations, they can be trained for specific material composition and are thus less affected by the flexibility issue of standard MD methods.
